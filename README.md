## üß© Project Overview
Beepong is a modular multiplayer Pong game with support for:

- AI opponents
- Tournament brackets
- Real-time play over WebSockets
- Frontend-backend separation
- Centralized log monitoring

I contributed to parts of the infrastructure and logging systems and helped bring the stack back to life in its final stages.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Multiplayer Pong Game**: Play in real-time against other players or an AI opponent.
- **Tournament Mode**: Create and join tournaments.
- **Lobby System**: Manage game lobbies.
- **AI Opponent**: Play against a AI in single-player mode.
  
### Infrastructure and Monitoring
- **ELK Stack Integration**: Provides real-time monitoring of game logs, player activity, and system performance.
  - **Elasticsearch** for indexing and searching logs.
  - **Logstash** for log processing and aggregation.
  - **Kibana** for visualizing logs and performance metrics.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Backend database supporting persistent player data and game history.
- **Nginx Server**: Handles front-end requests, ensuring smooth game delivery and hosting static assets.

## System Architecture

The Beepong architecture is divided into multiple services running within Docker containers:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla javascript-based interface where users interact with the game.
- **Backend**: Django-based REST API that handles game logic, player management, and real-time communication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database stores persistent game data, user accounts, and match results.
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana work together to provide detailed logging and analytics for real-time monitoring.

### üîç System Observability

Real-time monitoring using the ELK Stack:

- View **log levels over time** (INFO, DEBUG, FATAL)  
- Visualize **authentication success/failure rates**  
- Monitor **backend service behavior and events**
