## Project Overview

Beepong is a modular multiplayer Pong game built to showcase real-time interactions and observability across services.  
It supports:

- AI opponent fallback for solo games  
- Tournament mode with brackets  
- Real-time multiplayer via WebSockets  
- Clear frontend-backend separation  
- Centralized log monitoring for observability

## Game Features

- **Multiplayer Pong**: Real-time gameplay against human or AI  
- **Lobby System**: Create, join, and manage game lobbies  
- **Tournament Mode**: Compete through bracket-based matches  
- **Chat & Presence**: Interact with players in real-time  
- **AI Mode**: Fall back to AI if no human opponent is found  

---

## System Architecture

Beepong uses a containerized microservice architecture:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA served via Nginx  
- **Backend**: Django-based API + WebSocket server  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user/game state persistence  
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy, static serving, load routing  
- **ELK Stack**: Monitoring and log aggregation for all services  

---

## System Observability

My part of this project involved integrating the **ELK stack**:

- Real-time log ingestion with Logstash  
- Searchable service logs with Elasticsearch  
- Dashboard creation in Kibana for insights  

üìä Example Visual Dashboards:
- **Postgres FATAL errors** over time  
- **Authentication success/failure rates**  
- **WebSocket traffic volume**  
- **Routing and 404s from NGINX**

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:liocle/42_transcendence.git
cd beepong
cp .env.example .env # Edit the required templated fields
make up_all
```

Then, open:
   - üïπÔ∏è Game frontend: [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443)
   - üìä Kibana logs UI: [http://localhost:5601](https://localhost:5601/)

## What I Learned
- Running a real-world multi-container application using Docker
- Setting up the ELK stack from scratch for real-time observability
- Collaborating with developers to ingest and structure backend and service logs
- Building visual dashboards in Kibana to support debugging and gameplay insights
- Understanding the importance of testing environments and reproducibility in full-stack development
